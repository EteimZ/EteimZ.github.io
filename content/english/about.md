I am an autodidact who is passionate about Science and Technology.

Currently fascinated by Machine learning & its applications, I'm curious by nature and interested in knowing how things work.

I love working on pet projects, building web apps with JavaScript, scripting with Python, and Reading/writing jupyter notebooks. I occasionally dabble with microcontrollers.
